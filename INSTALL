= AsciiDoc3 Installation

NOTE: The current version of AsciiDoc3 requires *Python 3.0 or newer*
to run. AsciiDoc3 will definitely crash when using Python2.x. Probably there are 
few systems in the real world running with Python 3.0, 3.1 or 3.2 any more. Python 3.3 / 3.4 / 3.5
is a good choice - but you don't need the most recent branch at all. Python is installed by
default in most Unix and GNU/Linux distributions. If you don't find an
up-to-date version of Python installed it can be downloaded from the official Python website
http://www.python.org/.


[WARNING]
Command line 'python3' obligatory! +
Please note: To run AsciiDoc3, the executable command 'python3' is a must-have. That means, typing 'python3' at the command line starts the Python3 executable. In almost every Unix and GNU/Linux distribution this is a given. When not, you can easily add a symlink python3 -> python3.5 and add python3 to your PATH ... +
Windows users need probably a 'windows alias for python 3' - use this as a search phrase on the net. You can find more information about this issue here: +

== Obtaining AsciiDoc3
See link:download.html[here].

== Installation

.Install AsciiDoc3 local!
************************************************************************
It seems to be a good idea to install AsciiDoc3 local in your home directory.
Doing so you can easily 'delete' the previous version and 'update' to the forthcoming 
first release 3.0.1!
************************************************************************


=== Tarball Installation
This installation is recommended for Unix and GNU/Linux-Users. 

- Download the tarball in any directory with read-write access, e.g. ~/download.
- Open a terminal and change to \~/download ('cd ~/download').
- Deflate the tarball ('tar -xzf asciidoc3-3.0.1rc.tar.gz').
- You see a new directory ~/download/asciidoc3-3.0.1rc
- Optional: Copy this directory and rename it to ~/asciidoc3 (so you have less typing labour ...)
- In the terminal: change to the new directory, e.g. ~/asciidoc3.
- Start using AsciiDoc3: 'python3 asciidoc3.py -n - icons -o smalltest.html smalltest.txt'
- Try out processing files of your own using other backends (docbook, html4),
- or try out 'a2x3.py' to generate good-looking pdf's ... (continue link:quickstart.html[here]).

=== Zip Installation
Windows users may go here. +
AsciiDoc3 is developed and tested on GNU/Linux. I have only limited access to such systems. But as said in the AsciiDoc v2 homepage, there seem to be quite a 
few people using it on Windows (I use the informations given there:). +

- To install AsciiDoc3 on Windows unzip the Zip file ('unzip asciidoc3-3.0.1rc.zip'),
- this will create the folder 'asciidoc3-3.0.1rc' containing the 'asciidoc3.py' and 'a2x3.py' executables along with configuration files,
- try 'python3 asciidoc3.py -n - icons -o ad3test.html ad3test.txt'... (continue link:quickstart.html[here]).

To generate DocBook based outputs (e.g. PDFs) you will also need a working DocBook toolchain. Installing and configuring a DocBook toolchain on Windows can be a challenge. If possible, I give you more information about this later on if this website will be updated.


=== Testing your installation
See link:quickstart.html[here].

=== Single User Installation / Make-File
In both ways of installing no admin/root-rights are necessary. +
The next version of AsciiDoc3 will provide a make-file to install the known way: +
$ ./configure && make && sudo make install


== Uninstall
Uninstall AsciiDoc3 is very easy: +
just delete the directory '~/asciidoc3' (or wherever you have installed the distribution).
